### **North Pole Express: A Parent-Managed Wishlist App**  

#### **Overview**  
WishLink is a streamlined wishlist management app designed for parents to create personalized wishlist URLs for their children. This allows kids to add their Christmas wishes in a simple, user-friendly interface while parents can easily track and manage their submissions.  

#### **Core Features**  

##### **1. Parent Dashboard** (Admin Panel)  
- A central hub for parents to create and manage wishlist links for each child.  
- View, edit, and organize all submitted wishlist items.  
- Ability to share or revoke access to wishlists.  

##### **2. Child-Friendly Wishlist Page**  
- Each wishlist has a unique, shareable URL generated by the system.  
- Minimalist UI with a simple "Add an Item" button.  
- Children can submit items via a text input or paste a link.  
- Instant sync with the parent dashboard upon submission.  

##### **3. Database & Hosting**  
- Built on **Supabase** for real-time data storage and retrieval.  
- Secure access control ensuring only parents can manage wishlists.  

#### **User Flow**  

1. **Parent creates an account** → Logs into the dashboard.  
2. **Parent generates a unique wishlist URL** → Shares it with their child.  
3. **Child accesses the URL** → Adds items via text or links.  
4. **Parent receives real-time updates** → Manages wishlists from the dashboard.  

#### **Potential Enhancements**  
- **Wishlist Organization:** Categorization of gifts (e.g., toys, books, electronics).  
- **Family Collaboration:** Ability to share wishlists with relatives.  
- **Gift Status Tracking:** Parents can mark items as "purchased" to avoid duplicates.  
- **Wishlist Expiration:** Set a deadline for wishlist submissions.  

#### **Technical Considerations**  
- **Frontend:** React or Next.js for a fast, responsive experience.  
- **Backend:** Supabase for authentication, real-time database updates, and API endpoints.  
- **Security:** Role-based access (parents vs. children), private wishlists.
